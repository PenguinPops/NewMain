                            <h2>C++ Development</h2>
                            <p>     I am passionate about programming, particularly in the C++ language. 
                            With a solid foundation in C++, 
                            I have honed my skills and developed a deep understanding of its intricacies. 
                            I find immense satisfaction in creating efficient and robust solutions through coding.
                             Whether it's building complex algorithms, developing software applications, or optimizing performance,
                              I am constantly driven to push the boundaries of what can be achieved with C++. I am always eager to expand my knowledge by exploring new libraries, frameworks, and best practices, as I believe that continuous learning is crucial in the ever-evolving field of programming. Through my dedication, problem-solving abilities, and meticulous attention to detail, I strive to deliver high-quality code that meets the demands of modern software development. Programming in C++ is not just a hobby or a career path for me; it's a true passion that fuels my desire to create innovative and impactful solutions.
                            </p>
                            <p></p>
                              <h2>C++ App Development with the Electron Framework</h2>
                            <p>     I have created a program called FormatC++ that aims to simplify code formatting for C++ developers. It is designed as a user-friendly Electron app with an intuitive interface. The main purpose of FormatC++ is to take unformatted code containing enumerations and transform it into a format that can be easily copied and used in any development environment.
                                <h3>Currently, FormatC++ offers the following functionalities:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Recognition and removal of numbers and spaces before the code.</li>
                                    <li>Identification of brackets and appropriate formatting.</li>
                                    <li>Deletion of empty lines for a cleaner code appearance.</li>
                                </ul>
                                With FormatC++, you can quickly and effortlessly format your C++ code, making it more readable and organized.</p>
